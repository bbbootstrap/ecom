<p><strong>Amazon PPC</strong> (Pay Per Click) is a form of advertising that has allowed sellers and vendors to run ads on Amazon for their products. It gives a great opportunity to sell more products online. If properly created and managed, a <strong>PPC campaign on Amazon</strong> can help you sell more inventory faster, while increasing your organic rankings as well.</p>
<p>If you are planning to launch the <strong>Amazon PPC campaign</strong>, then you should have a strategy and your product list should be optimized. Most of the time, people just launch a PPC campaign thinking that their product listings have the most commonly used words and are relevant to the organic search results. But general optimization doesn’t work for PPC all the time.</p>
<p><strong> FEW THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW FOR BEST RESULTS FROM YOUR PPC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You should try some of the automated ad campaign features along with the manual campaigns to get the best results.</li>
<li>Try to add similar products having similar keywords in the same ad group. Because having products with variant keywords will not lead to any conversion.</li>
<li>You need to make sure that ad groups and product listings contain the keywords that match the customer’s query. Search engines will provide the most relevant listings no matter if it is paid or organic traffic.</li>
<li>You must be familiar with the concept of negative keywords. Utilize negative keywords and utilize keyword match types as well.</li>
<li>Allocate the budget according to the performance of the product.</li>
<li>Instead of using shorter keywords, you should try to get specific with long tail keywords.</li>
<li>Your campaigns should be well-structured consistently. If you don’t follow a campaign structure, then the overlap could lead to repeat ads. Staying organized throughout the campaign will make it less confusing for you to manage it.</li>
<li>Remove less selling products from the ad group to use your budget wisely on ads for those products which sell most and have high ROI.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ecommercevision.in/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1438 alignnone" src="https://www.ecommercevision.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/c3f822a4-2d64-4591-b914-20cf0287b1e7.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="765" /></a></p>
<p>Amazon operates on a fundamentally different structure than either of those shopping sites. Be sure your store is capable of handling selling on Amazon, and that your strategy is aligned with Amazon policies- so you get the highest ROI (Return of Investment) on the Amazon Marketplace.</p>
<p>Amazon has very clear selling policies and outlines best practices and mistakes to avoid for Amazon retailers within <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help-page.html/ref=ag_200421970_cont_scsearch?ie=UTF8&amp;itemID=200421970">Seller Centra</a>l to make sure the buyers have the best shopping experience. Everything Amazon do is driven by the shopper experience.</p>
<p><strong>Provide Accurate Product Data</strong>: You should know that the content and format will make or break you. Make sure your product description and condition notes are clear and helpful to buyers. It&#8217;s important that buyers get exactly the product described on the detail page where you place your listing. <strong>It is recommended not copy and other seller data or images directly from their listings as this may lead to copyright complains against you and will affect your account badly </strong>and this is also against Amazon listing policy.</p>
<p><strong>Check for Orders Daily:</strong> To ship quickly you need to find out about orders promptly. If you have signed up for order notifications, you will get an e-mail you when you have a sale, but e-mails are unreliable and can be caught by spam filters. That is why it is recommended checking for orders daily on Seller Central. Under the Orders tab you can view a list of orders and set up automatic order reports.</p>
<p><strong>Confirm When You Ship:</strong> Fulfillment is one of Amazon’s biggest temptations for Amazon shoppers. Prime members enjoy expedited shipping (among other features), and pay for that delivery speed. Amazon charges the buyer&#8217;s credit card only after shipment is confirmed. Once an order is placed, you are responsible for confirming shipment within the time that you have specified in your shipping settings or else your performance metrics will be affected and <strong>delay in confirming shipment will lead to increase in LDR (Late Dispatch Rate) and the threshold which needs to be maintained for this is &lt;4%. And it may also lead to auto cancellation of orders and for this you will be charged and also the PCR (Pre-Fulfillment Cancellation Rate) will increase and the threshold for this which needs to be maintained is &lt;2.5%. </strong>Make sure your customer-facing policies and management is up to mark.</p>
<p><strong>Check your Inventory Regularly:</strong> Keep checking on quantity of inventory you have in stock, especially if you sell on multiple portals<strong>. If you receive any orders for products that turn out not to be in stock then they are likely to leave negative feedback which will lead to increase in ODR (Order Defect Rate) and the threshold which needs to be maintained for this is &lt;1%.</strong> If you get into this situation, the best move is to quickly inform the buyer and, if appropriate, offer to compensate them for their trouble.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ecommercevision.in/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1434 aligncenter" src="https://www.ecommercevision.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Capture.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="298" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Keep Pricing Accurate At All Times:</strong> The More Buying Choices page displays the lowest priced items first. Amazon shoppers are always looking for the best deals and are more inclined to purchase items that appear at the top of the More Buying Choices page. This happen mostly incase if you are selling branded products and it is recommended to use automate pricing tool in this case. So it is advised to keep pricing accurate all the times.</p>
<p><strong>Be Sure To Align Your Shipping And Fulfillment Policies:</strong> The best way to avoid disappointing buyers is to set expectations and then meet them. When creating your shipping policy clearly let customers know how often orders are processed, how frequently you ship, the carriers you use, and how to contact you with shipping related questions<strong>. Buyers will be disappointed if their item arrives late or the item is damaged; this can lead to negative feedback, refunds, or A-to-z Guarantee claims, all of which may have negative consequences for your account i.e. increase in ODR percentage</strong><u>.</u></p>
<p><strong>Be Accessible To Customers:</strong> Nothing is more frustrating to a buyer than not knowing the status of their order. <strong>Respond quickly to buyer contacts and notify them when an order&#8217;s shipment is delayed.</strong> Make it easy for customers to know how to reach you so that they trust that you will make their shopping experience go smoothly.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Build A Good Feedback Rating:</strong> Customers pay close attention to feedback, and so your performance is monitored on this basis. <strong>The keys to good feedback are accurately describing your items, delivering items to buyers quickly, and being prompt in responding to buyer questions.</strong> You can also request the buyer for feedback by contacting them through messages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ecommercevision.in/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1442 aligncenter" src="https://www.ecommercevision.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="324" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Handle Returns And Refunds Gracefully: </strong>No one looks forward to taking returns and making refunds, but it is part of selling and a requirement of the Amazon sales process. <strong>Taking returns gracefully can lead to better feedback about your customer service.</strong> You are required to take returns of most items up to 30 days after delivery and your policy must be at least as favorable as Amazon&#8217;s policy.</p>
<p>Apart from the above the key to keeping your account up to date is by following everything as per Amazon guidelines and following their policies. This will ensure you experience <strong>“Happy Selling on Amazon”</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>What is Amazon PPC or Sponsored Ads?</em> </strong></p>
<p>Amazon sponsored ads use a method called pay-per-click (PPC). Pay-per-click is an advertising method wherein the advertiser only pays for the ad once a potential buyer clicks on the ad to view their product. This method is also called CPC(Cost Per Click). PPC works differently than pay-per-mil advertising PPM, which is an impressions-based method of advertising like Facebook uses. With PPM, the advertiser pays for every 1,000 people who see the ad, versus those who click on the ads.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where do Sponsored Product ads appear on Amazon?</em> </strong></p>
<p>Sponsored product ads can appear on Amazon in a variety of places, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amazon’s search engine results page: &#8211; When a buyer logs onto Amazon and types something into the search bar, Amazon loads a page full of results.</li>
<li>Headlines: &#8211; branded products on Amazon that have three or more products in their catalog can purchase headline ads. These ads often appear at the top of the Amazon Search Page.</li>
<li>Product pages. Advertisements even appear on product pages in a few different areas. In the desktop view, just below the fold there is a band of products with the heading “sponsored products related to this item.” Amazon’s always changing things up and testing new channels, too. So don’t be surprised if you see your ads in other places.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em> Why advertise on Amazon?</em> </strong></p>
<p>Advertising on Amazon is the best way to get your product in front of more people or we can also say potential buyers. There are millions and millions of products available on Amazon. And even you have picked the perfect product and your product is available on Amazon, you still have to let the world know about it. Otherwise it’s going to be visible on 4 or 5 pages deep on Amazon Result’s page. And you don’t want that. A similar principle is used by clients when in partnership with <a href="https://themarketingheaven.com/shop/youtube-subscribers/">The Marketing Heaven</a>, for example, they promote a video on YouTube in order to collect as many subscribers as possible and thus highlight their profile on that social network. But when it comes to Amazon, PPC is the best way to bring your product on top page and the more people see your product, the more you get the clicks and the more sales you make.</p>
