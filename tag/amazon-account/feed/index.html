<p><strong>Why it is important for all sellers.</strong></p>
<p>It is important for all sellers because seller can get data report that how much money it is deducting and receiving from market places .Whether it is courier charges, commission fee, advertisement etc.</p>
<p><strong>Reconciliation helps in</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Matching the payment.</li>
<li>To know for which orders marketplace has not paid.</li>
<li>To find any extra commissions or logistic charges deducted.</li>
<li>Can claim for refund of amount which is wrongly charged after reconciliation done.</li>
</ul>

<p>Amazon operates on a fundamentally different structure than either of those shopping sites. Be sure your store is capable of handling selling on Amazon, and that your strategy is aligned with Amazon policies- so you get the highest ROI (Return of Investment) on the Amazon Marketplace.</p>
<p>Amazon has very clear selling policies and outlines best practices and mistakes to avoid for Amazon retailers within <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help-page.html/ref=ag_200421970_cont_scsearch?ie=UTF8&amp;itemID=200421970">Seller Centra</a>l to make sure the buyers have the best shopping experience. Everything Amazon do is driven by the shopper experience.</p>
<p><strong>Provide Accurate Product Data</strong>: You should know that the content and format will make or break you. Make sure your product description and condition notes are clear and helpful to buyers. It&#8217;s important that buyers get exactly the product described on the detail page where you place your listing. <strong>It is recommended not copy and other seller data or images directly from their listings as this may lead to copyright complains against you and will affect your account badly </strong>and this is also against Amazon listing policy.</p>
<p><strong>Check for Orders Daily:</strong> To ship quickly you need to find out about orders promptly. If you have signed up for order notifications, you will get an e-mail you when you have a sale, but e-mails are unreliable and can be caught by spam filters. That is why it is recommended checking for orders daily on Seller Central. Under the Orders tab you can view a list of orders and set up automatic order reports.</p>
<p><strong>Confirm When You Ship:</strong> Fulfillment is one of Amazon’s biggest temptations for Amazon shoppers. Prime members enjoy expedited shipping (among other features), and pay for that delivery speed. Amazon charges the buyer&#8217;s credit card only after shipment is confirmed. Once an order is placed, you are responsible for confirming shipment within the time that you have specified in your shipping settings or else your performance metrics will be affected and <strong>delay in confirming shipment will lead to increase in LDR (Late Dispatch Rate) and the threshold which needs to be maintained for this is &lt;4%. And it may also lead to auto cancellation of orders and for this you will be charged and also the PCR (Pre-Fulfillment Cancellation Rate) will increase and the threshold for this which needs to be maintained is &lt;2.5%. </strong>Make sure your customer-facing policies and management is up to mark.</p>
<p><strong>Check your Inventory Regularly:</strong> Keep checking on quantity of inventory you have in stock, especially if you sell on multiple portals<strong>. If you receive any orders for products that turn out not to be in stock then they are likely to leave negative feedback which will lead to increase in ODR (Order Defect Rate) and the threshold which needs to be maintained for this is &lt;1%.</strong> If you get into this situation, the best move is to quickly inform the buyer and, if appropriate, offer to compensate them for their trouble.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ecommercevision.in/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1434 aligncenter" src="https://www.ecommercevision.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Capture.jpg" alt="" width="627" height="298" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Keep Pricing Accurate At All Times:</strong> The More Buying Choices page displays the lowest priced items first. Amazon shoppers are always looking for the best deals and are more inclined to purchase items that appear at the top of the More Buying Choices page. This happen mostly incase if you are selling branded products and it is recommended to use automate pricing tool in this case. So it is advised to keep pricing accurate all the times.</p>
<p><strong>Be Sure To Align Your Shipping And Fulfillment Policies:</strong> The best way to avoid disappointing buyers is to set expectations and then meet them. When creating your shipping policy clearly let customers know how often orders are processed, how frequently you ship, the carriers you use, and how to contact you with shipping related questions<strong>. Buyers will be disappointed if their item arrives late or the item is damaged; this can lead to negative feedback, refunds, or A-to-z Guarantee claims, all of which may have negative consequences for your account i.e. increase in ODR percentage</strong><u>.</u></p>
<p><strong>Be Accessible To Customers:</strong> Nothing is more frustrating to a buyer than not knowing the status of their order. <strong>Respond quickly to buyer contacts and notify them when an order&#8217;s shipment is delayed.</strong> Make it easy for customers to know how to reach you so that they trust that you will make their shopping experience go smoothly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ecommercevision.in/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1441 aligncenter" src="https://www.ecommercevision.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-1.jpg" alt="" width="639" height="255" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Build A Good Feedback Rating:</strong> Customers pay close attention to feedback, and so your performance is monitored on this basis. <strong>The keys to good feedback are accurately describing your items, delivering items to buyers quickly, and being prompt in responding to buyer questions.</strong> You can also request the buyer for feedback by contacting them through messages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ecommercevision.in/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1442 aligncenter" src="https://www.ecommercevision.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/3-1.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="324" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Handle Returns And Refunds Gracefully: </strong>No one looks forward to taking returns and making refunds, but it is part of selling and a requirement of the Amazon sales process. <strong>Taking returns gracefully can lead to better feedback about your customer service.</strong> You are required to take returns of most items up to 30 days after delivery and your policy must be at least as favorable as Amazon&#8217;s policy.</p>
<p>Apart from the above the key to keeping your account up to date is by following everything as per Amazon guidelines and following their policies. This will ensure you experience <strong>“Happy Selling on Amazon”</strong>.</p>

<p>To sell on Amazon, you can go through the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <a href="http://services.amazon.com/">Services.amazon.com</a></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scroll down and click the “Selling on Amazon” link .</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ecommercevision.in/"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1412 aligncenter" src="https://www.ecommercevision.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="323" /></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select between “Sell as a Professional” or “Sell as an Individual”. <strong>As a beginner we recommend selling as an individual</strong>. Amazon charges $0.99 per sale. For a professional seller account Amazon charges $39.99 per month.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to Open an Amazon.com Account</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use your <strong>personal information</strong>, you don’t need a “legal” business right away to start an Amazon business.</p>
<p>Your personal tax information (social security number) is perfectly fine because you can claim any earnings as personal income to start.  If you’re <a href="https://www.ecommercevision.in/">selling on Amazon from outside the US it’s covered that in this article</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to sell on Amazon from outside the US this is what you currently need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Credit Card that can be charged internationally. Visa or Mastercard are the most common ones.</li>
<li>A local bank in your country that supports what’s known as ACH (automated clearing house) which only means that your local bank can receive electronic transfer payments from Amazon.</li>
<li>Your home address where you receive personal mail.</li>
<li>local phone number with your countries prefix.</li>
</ul>
<p>There you go, it’s that simple.</p>
